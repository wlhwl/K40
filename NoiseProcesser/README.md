# NoiseProcesser-beta
### Quick start
In app folder, 
```
cmake ..
make -j8
./run.sh
```
**Remember to run hDOM simulation first. The NoiseProcesser would app QE automatically.**

### Choose what kind of noise to generate in config
Now it has:
- K40 for hDOM
- Dark Noise for PMT

#### K40
K40 is generated by assuming the events at each coincidence level are Poisson process. The frequency of the events is from full MC simulation which could be edited in config.

#### Dark Noise
The dark noise rate could be changed in config. The generation of dark noise is assuming the number of dark photon in given time is Gamma distribution and the time of each dark photon is unifrom.

### Choose which hDOM to generate noise
choose it in config
- rage mode: generate noise for the whole detector array
- humble mode: only generate noise for selected range of hDOM
  - track: a cylinder whose center is the track, the radius could be changed in config
  - cascade: a sphere whose center is the vertex, the radius could be changed in config
